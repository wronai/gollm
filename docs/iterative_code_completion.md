# Iterative Code Completion Feature

## Overview

The Iterative Code Completion feature enhances the GoLLM code generation pipeline by automatically detecting incomplete or placeholder functions in generated code and prompting the LLM to complete them through multiple iterations without user intervention.

## Key Components

### 1. Incomplete Function Detector

Located in `src/gollm/validation/validators/incomplete_function_detector.py`, this module:

- Uses AST parsing to detect incomplete functions in Python code
- Identifies functions with empty bodies, `pass` statements, ellipsis (`...`), or TODO/FIXME comments
- Extracts function signatures and bodies for targeted completion
- Provides utilities to format code with TODO comments for LLM completion prompts
- Merges completed functions from LLM responses back into the original code

### 2. Validation Coordinator Integration

The validation coordinator (`validation_coordinator.py`) has been updated to expose the incomplete function detection functionality through a helper function `check_for_incomplete_functions`.

### 3. LLM Orchestrator Enhancement

The LLM orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`) now:

- Checks for incomplete functions after validating code quality
- If incomplete functions are found and the iteration limit isn't reached, it marks the validation result to trigger further completion
- Processes completed functions from LLM responses and merges them with the original code
- Re-validates the merged code to ensure quality
- Adjusts the response score based on the presence of incomplete functions

### 4. Prompt Formatter Update

The prompt formatter (`prompt_formatter.py`) has been enhanced to:

- Detect when incomplete functions exist in the previous attempt
- Build specialized prompts for completing incomplete functions
- Provide clear instructions to the LLM to focus on completing the marked functions

## How It Works

1. The LLM generates initial code based on the user's request
2. The code validator checks for syntax, quality, and incomplete functions
3. If incomplete functions are detected:
   - The system formats a specialized prompt highlighting the incomplete functions
   - The LLM is prompted to complete these functions while maintaining their signatures and docstrings
   - The completed functions are extracted and merged with the original code
   - The process repeats until all functions are completed or the iteration limit is reached
4. The final code with completed functions is returned to the user

## Benefits

- Improves code generation quality by ensuring functions are fully implemented
- Reduces the need for manual intervention to complete placeholder functions
- Maintains function signatures and docstrings during completion
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing code generation pipeline
- Respects iteration limits to prevent infinite loops

## Testing

Tests for the iterative code completion feature can be found in:

- `tests/validation/test_incomplete_function_detector.py` - Tests for the incomplete function detector module
- `tests/llm/test_iterative_completion.py` - Integration tests for the iterative completion process
